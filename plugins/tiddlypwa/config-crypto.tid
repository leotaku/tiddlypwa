\define tv-wikilinks() no

The password (or technically, the encryption key derived from it) is currently
<$reveal type="match" state="$:/status/TiddlyPWARemembered" text="yes">
''remembered'' on this device. <$button message="tiddlypwa-forget">Forget it</$button>?
</$reveal>
<$reveal type="nomatch" state="$:/status/TiddlyPWARemembered" text="yes">
''not remembered'' on this device. <$button message="tiddlypwa-remember">Remember it</$button>?
</$reveal>

(Warning: remembering the password would leave the contents of this wiki unprotected on the local device,
including from other wikis or other apps hosted on this

Do not do this if you store secrets here!)

The salt value for this wiki is: <code>{{$:/status/TiddlyPWASalt}}</code>
(if you were to manually initialize a new one to sync with this one, you would need to copy this value).
