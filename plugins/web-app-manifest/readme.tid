!! ~TiddlyPWA Manifest

This plugin dynamically generates and applies a [[Web App Manifest|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest]]
for the wiki, which is necessary for "add to home screen" style web app installation in browsers.

When saving the wiki (as a new TiddlyPWA app HTML file), the manifest is also inlined into the `<head>`.
Having the manifest be statically present in the file increases compatibility with [[browser bugs|https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16672]].

You can also <$button message="tiddlypwa-get-manifest">download the current manifest as a file</$button>.

!!! Manifest Generation

The `name` is taken from [[$:/plugins/valpackett/web-app-manifest/name]], which by default just includes the wiki's title.

Colors are taken from [[$:/plugins/valpackett/web-app-manifest/background-color]] and
[[$:/plugins/valpackett/web-app-manifest/theme-color]], which by default take the current palette's colors.

Icons are collected from tiddlers tagged with `$:/tags/ManifestIcon`, but if none have that tag, [[$:/favicon.ico]] is chosen if it exists.
(Obviously you can add the tag to [[$:/favicon.ico]] if you want to use it //and// others.)
Icons can be of any image type, including SVG.
For each icon, tiddler fields `sizes` and `purpose` can be used to set these properties for the icon in the manifest.
