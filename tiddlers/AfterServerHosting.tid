!! What to Do Next

Opening the `/` home page of the hosted sync server will let you access the admin console with the admin password.
There, you can create "wikis", i.e. storage slots that can store synchronized tiddlers ''and'' an app wiki, i.e. the TiddlyWiki HTML file with plugins and themes in it.

Hosting the app wiki on the sync server is not obligatory, but ''highly recommend'' because it simplifies setup on multiple devices and allows easy plugin/theme installation.

Once you have created a storage slot, you get a token that you can use for syncing the tiddlers and uploading the app wiki.

* if you've ''just created the slot'', you can use [[UploadApp]] from here to upload a fresh app wiki;
* if you've ''already'' synced with it from a local-only wiki (e.g. opened from [[here|TiddlyPWA]] using the "Try It Now" form), click the {{$:/core/images/save-button}} save button inside it, select the "{{$:/plugins/valpackett/tiddlypwa/save-dialog-app!!caption}}" tab and click "upload the app wiki to sync servers".

Upon uploading the app wiki, you'll see the URL for the hosted app wiki. Now you should bookmark that URL and use it to access the wiki.
It will also be accessible from the admin panel, by clicking the app wiki size.

Enjoy!
