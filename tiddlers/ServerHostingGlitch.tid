title: ServerHosting/Glitch
tags: [[TiddlyPWA Docs]]

[[Glitch|https://glitch.com/]] is a service that can host a TiddlyPWA sync server for free instantly.

Just make up an admin password and click the remix button that appears:

<div class="tc-control-panel">

|tc-table-no-border tc-max-width tc-first-col-min-width|k
| Password|<$edit-text tiddler="$:/temp/AdminPassGlitch" tag="input" default="" /> |
| |<$admin-password-hash password={{$:/temp/AdminPassGlitch}} glitch=true /> |

</div>

Note: the admin password SHOULD NOT match any wiki password!

By the way, you can even do this without an account.
However anonymous apps on Glitch expire in 5 days and only have 120 hours of running time, so you should sign up.

The admin password can be changed later: use [[HashAdminPassword]] and put the results in the `.env` file in the project editor.

!! Updating

You can use the Terminal in the Glitch editor to quickly update the server by pasting this command:

`/app/.deno/bin/deno cache --reload https://codeberg.org/valpackett/tiddlypwa/raw/branch/release/server/run.ts && killall deno`

The `refresh` command can also be used, it forces a reinstall of all dependencies including Deno itself.
