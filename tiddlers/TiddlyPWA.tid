Welcome! ~TiddlyPWA turns [[TiddlyWiki 5|https://tiddlywiki.com]]
into an ''offline-first'' [[Progressive Web App|https://web.dev/learn/pwa/progressive-web-apps/]]
with ''encrypted'' local persistent storage and efficient ''synchronization'' with a server
application that can easily be hosted for free.

!! How it works

You have an instance of ~TiddlyWiki with the ~TiddlyPWA plugin running in the browser.
The wiki HTML file is called the "app wiki" because it only contains plugins and basic settings.
The loaded plugin stores tiddlers in the browser via ~IndexedDB, scoped to the URL you're running the wiki from.
They are encrypted at rest with a key derived from a password,
which you can remember if you don't need to protect your data against anything/anyone with access to the browser.

The plugin can also synchronize your tiddlers with one or more sync servers, which you can specify in the settings.
On a sync server, a particular wiki is identified by a token, which is like a password
(but it's used on its own, without anything like a username).
These tokens are created in the server's admin interface.
To start syncing the same wiki to a second browser (device) you need to open the app wiki there,
start with the same encryption password, and add the same sync server URL and sync token.

The server can also store the app wiki HTML, which makes it really easy to install plugins:
the plugin will be able to generate and store a new version of the app wiki and directly reload into it.
The downside is that the server has to be trusted not to deliver you a backdoored version of the app wiki,
however we'll be able to somewhat improve on that by making it "trust on first use" with signatures.

<details>
<summary>Upload this running client app wiki to a sync serverâ€¦</summary>

{{$:/plugins/valpackett/tiddlypwa/upload-app-form}}

{{$:/status/TiddlyPWAUploadResult}}
</details>

<details>
<summary>Create a new client app wiki manually</summary>

First, either start with this page or add the following plugins to a fresh TiddlyWiki file:

{{$:/plugins/valpackett/tiddlypwa||$:/core/ui/Components/plugin-info}}
{{$:/plugins/valpackett/tiddlypwa-offline||$:/core/ui/Components/plugin-info}}
{{$:/plugins/valpackett/web-app-manifest||$:/core/ui/Components/plugin-info}}

Then add any other plugins/themes/palettes you are going to use (important since TiddlyWiki
won't load plugins from the local storage).

It's also a really good idea to set a title, subtitle, and the list of default tiddlers,
if you can live with those being unencrypted.

Now save the wiki HTML file and upload it to a good static file host along with
a very important [[sw.js|$:/plugins/valpackett/tiddlypwa-offline/sw.js]] file
that must reside in the same directory.
