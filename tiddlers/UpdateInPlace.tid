You can drag and drop these into a running TiddlyPWA instance:

{{$:/core||$:/core/ui/Components/plugin-info}}
{{$:/plugins/valpackett/tiddlypwa||$:/core/ui/Components/plugin-info}}
{{$:/plugins/valpackett/web-app-manifest||$:/core/ui/Components/plugin-info}}

And if you have app uploading to the sync server working, just import them and upload the app wiki and you have everything updated!
