title: UploadApp
tags: [[TiddlyPWA Docs]]

Enter the [[Synchronization]] server endpoint URL and the token of the wiki storage slot you want to upload a fresh app wiki into:

{{$:/plugins/valpackett/tiddlypwa/upload-app-form}}

{{$:/status/TiddlyPWAUploadResult}}

The fresh app wiki will contain TiddlyWiki core {{$:/core!!version}} and TiddlyPWA {{$:/plugins/valpackett/tiddlypwa!!version}}.

Note: when uploading into a slot that is not brand new and untouched (i.e. for recovering from a broken update) you'll need to use the "Clear Auth" button in the admin interface first.

The correct way to update a wiki that works fine is to [[UpdateInPlace]]!
